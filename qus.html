        <span class="text-red-400">Q1.</span>Discuss the scope of var, let, and
        const
      </h3>
      <p>
        <span class="text-lime-600 font-semibold text-lg">Ans:</span>In
        JavaScript, the scope of variables declared using var, let, and const
        differs, determining where and how these variables can be accessed
        within your code. Let's delve into the scope of each of these variable
        declarations:
        <br />
        <span class="text-lg font-medium">1.var:</span> <br />
        <ul class="list-disc pl-8">
          <li>var has a function-level or global scope, depending on where it's declared.</li>
          <li>If declared inside a function, it's limited to that function's scope.</li>
          <li>If declared outside of any function, it becomes a global variable, accessible throughout the entire script.</li>
          <li>Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their containing function or script, which means you can access them before their declaration, but they'll have an initial value of undefined.</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <span class="text-lg font-medium">2.let:</span> <br />
       <ul class="list-disc pl-8">
        <li>let has a block-level scope, meaning it's confined to the block (enclosed by curly braces) in which it's declared.</li>
        <li>Unlike var, let variables are not hoisted to the top of the block. They can only be accessed after their declaration within the block.</li>
        <li>Variables declared with let can be reassigned within the same block-level scope.</li>

       </ul>
        
        <br />
        <span class="text-lg font-medium">3.const:</span> <br />

        <ul class="list-disc pl-8">
          <li>const also has block-level scope, similar to let. It's limited to the block in which it's declared.</li>
          <li>Variables declared with const must be assigned a value when declared and cannot be reassigned to a new value. However, the properties of objects and elements of arrays declared with const can be modified.</li>
        </ul>

    <!-- second question -->
    <div class="my-6">
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">
        <span class="text-red-400">Q2.</span>Tell us the use cases of null and
        undefined?
      </h3>
      <p>
        <span class="text-lime-600 font-semibold text-lg">Ans:</span>
        In JavaScript, null and undefined are used to represent the absence of a
        value. Null is explicitly assigned by the programmer to indicate that a
        variable has no value, while undefined means that a variable has been
        declared but has not been assigned a value. These values can be used in
        various scenarios such as checking for the existence of an object
        property, indicating errors or empty values in functions, and
        initializing variables.

    <div class="my-6">
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">
        <span class="text-red-400">Q3.</span>What do you mean by REST API? ?
      </h3>
      <p>
        <span class="text-lime-600 font-semibold text-lg">Ans:</span> REST API
        stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming
        Interface. It is a set of guidelines and principles for building and
        interacting with web services. REST is an architectural style that is
        commonly used in designing networked applications. REST APIs allow
        different software applications to communicate with each other over the
        internet using HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. The key
        principles of REST include: <br />
        <br />
        <span class="text-lg font-medium">1.Client-Server Architecture:</span>
        Separation of concerns between the client (the application making the
        request) and the server (the application providing the resource). <br />
        <br />
        <span class="text-lg font-medium">2.Statelessness:</span> Each request
        from the client to the server must contain all the information needed to
        understand and process the request. The server doesn't store any client
        state between requests. <br />
        <br />
        <span class="text-lg font-medium">3.Cacheability:</span> Responses from
        the server can be cached by clients to improve performance and reduce
        the need for repeated requests. <br />
        <br />
        <span class="text-lg font-medium">4.Uniform Interface:</span> A
        consistent set of well-defined methods (HTTP verbs) for interacting with
        resources. Resources are represented in a standardized format, such as
        JSON or XML. <br />
        <br />
        <span class="text-lg font-medium">5.Layered System:</span> The
        architecture can be composed of multiple layers, with each layer having
        a specific functionality. <br />
        <br />
        <span class="text-lg font-medium">6.Code on Demand (optional):</span>
        The ability to send executable code from the server to the client, which
        the client can run within its own context.
        <br />
        <br />
        REST APIs are widely used for building web applications, mobile apps,
        and other distributed systems. They provide a flexible and scalable way
        for different software components to communicate and exchange data over
        the internet.
