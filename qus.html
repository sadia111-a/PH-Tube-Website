        <span class="text-red-400">Q1.</span>Discuss the scope of var, let, and
        const
      </h3>
      <p>
        <span class="text-lime-600 font-semibold text-lg">Ans:</span>Certainly!
        In programming, var, let, and const are used to declare variables in
        JavaScript. They have different scopes and behaviors. Here's a breakdown
        of their scopes: <br />
        <span class="text-lg font-medium">1.var:</span> <br />
        Variables declared with var have function scope or global scope,
        depending on whether they are declared within a function or outside of
        any function. This means that variables declared with var are not
        block-scoped; they are accessible throughout the entire function or
        globally if declared outside of any function. var variables are also
        subject to "hoisting," where the declaration is moved to the top of the
        function or scope during the compilation phase. <br />
        <span class="text-lg font-medium">2.let:</span> <br />

        Variables declared with let have block scope. A block is typically a set
        of curly braces {} that define a code block, such as in loops or
        conditional statements. Unlike var, let variables are not hoisted to the
        top of the scope, which can prevent some unexpected behaviors in your
        code. let allows you to create variables that are limited in scope to
        the block, statement, or expression containing them. <br />
        <span class="text-lg font-medium">3.const:</span> <br />

        Variables declared with const also have block scope, similar to let.
        However, variables declared with const must be assigned a value when
        they are declared, and once assigned, their value cannot be changed.
        They are constant. Like let, const variables are also not hoisted.

        <span class="text-red-400">Q2.</span>Tell us the use cases of null and
        undefined?
      </h3>
      <p>
        <span class="text-lime-600 font-semibold text-lg">Ans:</span>
        In JavaScript, null and undefined are used to represent the absence of a
        value. Null is explicitly assigned by the programmer to indicate that a
        variable has no value, while undefined means that a variable has been
        declared but has not been assigned a value. These values can be used in
        various scenarios such as checking for the existence of an object
        property, indicating errors or empty values in functions, and
        initializing variables.

        <span class="text-red-400">Q3.</span>What do you mean by REST API? ?
      </h3>
      <p>
        <span class="text-lime-600 font-semibold text-lg">Ans:</span> REST API
        stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming
        Interface. It is a set of guidelines and principles for building and
        interacting with web services. REST is an architectural style that is
        commonly used in designing networked applications. REST APIs allow
        different software applications to communicate with each other over the
        internet using HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. The key
        principles of REST include: <br />
        <br />
        <span class="text-lg font-medium">1.Client-Server Architecture:</span>
        Separation of concerns between the client (the application making the
        request) and the server (the application providing the resource). <br />
        <br />
        <span class="text-lg font-medium">2.Statelessness:</span> Each request
        from the client to the server must contain all the information needed to
        understand and process the request. The server doesn't store any client
        state between requests. <br />
        <br />
        <span class="text-lg font-medium">3.Cacheability:</span> Responses from
        the server can be cached by clients to improve performance and reduce
        the need for repeated requests. <br />
        <br />
        <span class="text-lg font-medium">4.Uniform Interface:</span> A
        consistent set of well-defined methods (HTTP verbs) for interacting with
        resources. Resources are represented in a standardized format, such as
        JSON or XML. <br />
        <br />
        <span class="text-lg font-medium">5.Layered System:</span> The
        architecture can be composed of multiple layers, with each layer having
        a specific functionality. <br />
        <br />
        <span class="text-lg font-medium">6.Code on Demand (optional):</span>
        The ability to send executable code from the server to the client, which
        the client can run within its own context.
        <br />
        <br />
        REST APIs are widely used for building web applications, mobile apps,
        and other distributed systems. They provide a flexible and scalable way
        for different software components to communicate and exchange data over
        the internet.
